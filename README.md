Music & Mental Health Analysis (ISYE 412 – Spring 2025)

This project investigates how music listening habits, genre preferences, BPM levels, and global streaming trends relate to mental health indicators such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD.

This analysis was completed as part of ISYE 412 – Industrial Data Analytics at UW-Madison.

📌 Objectives

Do music genre preferences differ across age groups?

Does music have greater therapeutic impact on certain conditions (Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, OCD)?

Is listening time correlated with mental-wellbeing?

How does genre BPM relate to mental health trends?

Do countries with higher streaming rates show different mental health prevalence?

📈 Key Findings

Younger age groups show more diverse genre preferences and higher reported symptoms.

Music has the strongest therapeutic impact on anxiety.

Listening time is statistically significant but weakly correlated with well-being.

Lower BPM genres (Classical, Lo-fi, Acoustic) are associated with OCD/Insomnia.

Countries with higher streaming minutes often show higher, not lower, disorder prevalence—likely due to confounding factors.
